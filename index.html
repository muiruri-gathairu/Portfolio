        <h4>education</h4>
        <p>I started learning my abc's at Limuru Model Nursery school where i studied for 3 years.
            Later on i moved to St.Joe's Uplands Academy for my primary school education. After primary school i joined
            Murang'a High School for my secondary school level education. I got an A- and a several months later i
            joined JKUAT juja branch. After an year of study i decided to quit so as to pursue my true passion which is
            and always will be programming.
            <h4>job experience</h4>
            <p>i have no notable job experience in the formal sector.</p>
            <h4>hello world</h4>
            <p>Earlier you read that my passion is coding. As i write this, i am currently at Moringa School honing my
                coding skills, meeting new people and getting to learn new exciting concepts.<br />
                I love watching sci-fi movies as they theorize about incredible future inventions made possible by
                technology and in the real world i want to do the same. I am learning programming to create new and
                still yet unimagined technologies for the progress of all mankind.</p>
